# 👋 Welcome to My World

🔥 "Imagine a world where machines move with intelligence, websites build themselves, and ideas spark revolutions." That’s the world I’m building.

I’m **Dineth Perera**, a second-year Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate with an unmatched drive to **innovate**, **automate**, and **inspire**. With a mind wired for robotics, signal systems, and AI, I’m on a mission to build impactful tech—from intelligent traffic systems and hybrid line-followers to AI website generators that convert thoughts into code.

But that’s only half the story.

🎤 As a proud member of **Toastmasters International**, I’ve honed the art of communication—delivering technical ideas with the same clarity and conviction as a keynote speech. Whether on stage or in a GitHub commit, I aim to **lead with impact, clarity, and confidence**.
