# 👋 Welcome 

🔥 .
I’m **Dineth Perera**, a second-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering undergraduate with a relentless passion to **innovate**, **automate**, and **inspire**. My journey blends **cutting-edge technology** with **visionary communication**—driving impact both on the circuit board and the stage.

Whether I’m designing a **high-speed line-following robot**, simulating intelligent **traffic systems**, building an **AI website generator**, or revolutionizing Sri Lanka’s auto market through **Raceday.lk**, I bring purpose to every pixel and pulse.

🎤 As a proud **Toastmasters** speaker and leader, I believe in empowering technology through human connection—turning complex ideas into compelling stories, and turning ideas into action.

🚘 I'm also the co-owner of **[Raceday.lk](https://instagram.com/racedaylk)** — Sri Lanka’s next-gen car marketplace powered by automation and creativity. From **Graph API integration** to modern front-end design, this platform bridges **automobiles with AI**.
